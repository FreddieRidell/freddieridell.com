		<h2>Experience</h2>

		<Experience
			position="Senior React Contractor"
			biz="Workshare, Sharp Gaming, Imagine Cruising"
			start={new Date("2018-02-18")}
		>
			<p>
				I have provided my development services for several clients,
				working as part of agile teams to deliver high quality web apps
				using modern react.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to development I have also trained junior team
				members, onboarded incoming mid/senior level developers, and
				driven foundational technical changes across codebases. I was
				trusted to investigate and implement the core state-management
				solution for a large scale green-field app, and drove an
				initiative to adopt state-of-the-art unit testing of an
				otherwise untested 200k LOC codebase.
			</p>
		</Experience>

		<Experience
			position="Co-founder/Lead Developer"
			biz="Codogo"
			end={new Date("2018-02-18")}
			start={new Date(1451606400000)}
		>
			<p>
				The core focus of my work has been producing Codogo Write, a
				modern writing web app with a focus on ease-of-use and polished
				user experience. We were invited to pitch with Y Combinator in
				California on the strength of the MVP I developed
			</p>
			<p>
				To support development of this product, I produced complex web
				and native apps and websites for over 20 clients, across a
				breadth of fields (including chat apps, social networks, and
				data-vis) both from scratch and on legacy systems in React and
				React Native
			</p>
		</Experience>

		<Experience
			position="Development Intern"
			biz="Amazon Instant Video"
			start={new Date(1433116800000)}
			end={new Date(1441065600000)}
		>
			<p>
				I worked on Amazonâ€™s native instant video player: a large scale
				real-time c++ codebase. I was responsible for porting it to OS X
				and fixing performance-critical memory bugs. Taking
				responsibility for mission-critical software and working to
				provide tooling for other developers allowed me to gain valuable
				experience in communicating with other developers across many
				other teams across Amazon
			</p>
		</Experience>

		<Experience
			position="Computer Science Degree (2:1)"
			biz="Durham University"
			start={new Date("2013-09-01")}
			end={new Date(1451606400000)}
		>
			<p>
				Dissertation: Designing, evaluating, and optimizing a system for
				population simulation
			</p>
			<p>
				During my degree I studied a wide range of subjects: from
				runtime/space analysis and higher order logic to database
				systems and software development best practices. My exposure to
				the full range of modern software at a world renowned university
				provided me with the rock solid foundation I needed to hit the
				ground running providing elegant and powerful solutions to every
				problem I've encountered since
