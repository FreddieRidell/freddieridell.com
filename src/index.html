            Using my broad knowledge of programming techniques and libraries, I
            specialise in designing systems and tooling that multiply the
            productivity of all team members.
          </p>
          <p>
            With smooth integration into new and existing teams I have trained
            junior team members, onboarded incoming mid/senior level developers,
            and driven foundational technical changes across codebases.

            I was brought in to manage content complexity by building a de novo
            data mapping layer for their CMS, to reduce ballooning data sizes
            and eliminate developer friction. This system shrunk first-load data
            sizes by <b>~20 times</b> on the
            <a href="https://www.hilton.com">www.hilton.com</a> homepage, and
            improved user-testing velocity by a <b>factor of 10</b>.

            I was brought on as part of their core frontend team, and drove an

            My core work was producing Codogo Write, a modern writing web app
            with a focus on ease-of-use and polished user experience. We were

            the MVP I developed.

          <p>
            To support development of this product, I produced complex web and

            fields (including chat apps, social networks, and data-vis) both
            from scratch and on legacy systems in React and React Native.
