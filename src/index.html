            I have provided my development services for several clients, working
            as part of agile teams to deliver high quality web apps using modern
            react.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to development I have also trained junior team members,
            onboarded incoming mid/senior level developers, and driven
            foundational technical changes across codebases. I was trusted to
            investigate and implement the core state-management solution for a
            large scale green-field app, and drove an initiative to adopt
            state-of-the-art unit testing of an otherwise untested 200k LOC
            codebase.

            My core work work was producing Codogo Write, a modern writing web
            app with a focus on ease-of-use and polished user experience. We
            were invited to pitch with Y Combinator in California on the
            strength of the MVP I developed
          </p>
          <p>
            To support development of this product, I produced complex web and
            native apps and websites for over 20 clients, across a breadth of
            fields (including chat apps, social networks, and data-vis) both
            from scratch and on legacy systems in React and React Native

            I worked on Amazon’s native instant video player: a large scale
            real-time c++ codebase. I was responsible for porting it to OS X and
            fixing performance-critical memory bugs. Taking responsibility for
            mission-critical software and working to provide tooling for other
            developers allowed me to gain valuable experience in communicating
            with other developers across many other teams at Amazon
