            I have provided my development services for several clients, working
            as part of agile teams to deliver high quality web apps using modern
            react. My specialty is leveraging my broad knowledge of programming
            techniques and libraries to design systems and tooling that multiply
            the productivity of all team members.
          </p>
          <p>
            I spearheaded a project to optimize ballooning data payloads on the
            <a href="https://www.hilton.com" class="underline">hilton.com</a>
            homepage, by writing a de novo content data mapping layer for their
            CMS. I also led Imagine Cruising's frontend team in their initiative
            to move all their franchised sites to a single white-labeled next.js
            codebase.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to development I have also trained junior team members,
            onboarded incoming mid/senior level developers, and driven
            foundational technical changes across codebases. I was trusted to
            investigate and implement the core state-management solution for a
            large scale green-field app, and drove an initiative to adopt
            state-of-the-art unit testing of an otherwise untested 200k LOC
            codebase.

            My core work was producing Codogo Write, a modern writing web app
            with a focus on ease-of-use and polished user experience. We were
            invited to pitch with Y Combinator in California on the strength of
            the MVP I developed.
          </p>
          <p>
            To support development of this product, I produced complex web and
            native apps and websites for over 20 clients, across a breadth of
            fields (including chat apps, social networks, and data-vis) both
            from scratch and on legacy systems in React and React Native.

            I worked on Amazon’s native instant video player: a large scale
            real-time c++ codebase. I was responsible for porting it to MacOS
            and fixing memory bugs. Taking responsibility for mission-critical
            software and working to provide tooling for other developers allowed
            me to gain valuable experience in communicating with other
            developers across many other teams at Amazon.

            During my degree I studied a wide range of subjects: from
            runtime/space analysis and higher order logic to database systems
            and software development best practices. My exposure to the full
            range of modern software at a world renowned university provided me
            with the rock solid foundation I needed to hit the ground running
            providing elegant and powerful solutions to every problem I've
            encountered since.
